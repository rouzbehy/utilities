# Utilities

Some Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that I used in the plotting of my results. Mostly these are used for the comparative study of _CUJET_ vs. _MARTINI_ and our study of the effect of the higher order collision kernels on AMY bremsstrahlung rates.

- `cujet_vs_martini/` : folder for the _CUJET_ vs. _MARTINI_ study. This also includes some of the Python binning and analysis scripts.

- `kernels/` : has the scripts and notebooks for the kernels study. It also has the GPR work.
