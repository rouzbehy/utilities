# Information

These runs are specifically to compare three types of runs:

1. _MARTINI_ stand-alone run with $(\kappa_{r},\kappa_{e})=(2.0, 8.5)$

2. _MARTINI+MATTER_ run in _JETSCAPE_ with $(\kappa_{r},\kappa_{e})=(1.5,4.5)$

3. _MARTINI+MATTER_ run in _JETSCAPE_ with $(\kappa_{r},\kappa_{e})=(2.0,8.5)$ 

Goal is to see if there's a difference. Specifically, if runs 1 and 2 have same behaviour in all observables other than jet $R_{AA}$. Hopefully there, #3 would match the data.
